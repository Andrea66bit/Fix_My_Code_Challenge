I just started a new Flask project and the first thing I’m putting in place is a route for the status of my API (super important for a load balancer implementation).

But I don’t know why it’s not working…

Could you look at it and fix it please?

My code is here

$ python -m api.v1.app 
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
....
$ curl -XGET http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/status
{
  "error": "Not found"
}
$
2. Step 2: User model

I’m running into a serious problem!

I just start my OOP project and nothing works…

Could you help me please? My code is here.

Thank you!
I finished and deployed my Rails blog but people are contacting me because they can’t access any of my blog posts… Weird, it works for me…

Could you take a look and fix it? My code base is here.

Also, when you’re done, could you add a new feature please?

I would like to add a boolean online for each Post object with a default value true. With this boolean, I will be able to hide/show some blog posts from the listing. I will also need a way to change this boolean in the Post#edit route. Could you do this for me?

Thank you!
